## What is Hey Day?
Hey day was originally created by Auburn's Student Government Association in 1947. It is a day to bring the Auburn family closer together. On hey day, there are many stations set up around the campus for students/faculty to create a nametag. The nametag is then worn and members of the Auburn community greet each other throughout the day. It is always so much fun and a tradition that I have enjoyed participating in throughout my time at Auburn. 

### Tradition in Code
The code I created mimics a normal conversation that would occur during Hey Day at Auburn.
